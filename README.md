Data Wrangling Process
In this project, I performed the below wrangling processes to make the data clean and ready for analysis.

Data Assessing
Data Cleaning
Quality issues
There are 8807 rows and 12 columns in this dataset.

I tackled the below Data Quality and Tidiness issues in the various datasets gathered.

Several columns (director, cast, country, date_added, rating & duration) had null objects in them. This was resolved.

The duration column type was identified as integer instead of float.

In this section, using the cleaned dataset, I was able to analyze and visualize insights below

Data wrangling is a skill that is needed since so much of the world's data isn't clean. Wrangling the dataset prevented me from missing out on important insights.
